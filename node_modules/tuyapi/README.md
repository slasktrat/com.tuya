A library for communicating with devices that use the [Tuya](http://tuya.com) cloud network. These devices are branded under many different names, but if your device works with the TuyaSmart app or port 6668 is open on your device chances are this library will work.

## Installation

  `npm install codetheweb/tuyapi`

## Basic Usage

See the [setup instructions](docs/SETUP.md) for how to find the needed parameters.

These examples should report the current status, set the default property to the opposite of what it currently is, then report the changed status.
They will need to be adapted if your device does not have a boolean property at index 1 (i.e. it doesn't have an on/off property).

### Asynchronous (event based, recommended)
```javascript
const TuyAPI = require('tuyapi');

const device = new TuyAPI({
  id: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  key: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'});

let stateHasChanged = false;

// Find device on network
device.find().then(() => {
  // Connect to device
  device.connect();
});

// Add event listeners
device.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connected to device!');
});

device.on('disconnected', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from device.');
});

device.on('error', error => {
  console.log('Error!', error);
});

device.on('data', data => {
  console.log('Data from device:', data);

  console.log(`Boolean status of default property: ${data.dps['1']}.`);

  // Set default property to opposite
  if (!stateHasChanged) {
    device.set({set: !(data.dps['1'])});

    // Otherwise we'll be stuck in an endless
    // loop of toggling the state.
    stateHasChanged = true;
  }
});

// Disconnect after 10 seconds
setTimeout(() => { device.disconnect(); }, 10000);
```

### Synchronous
```javascript
const TuyAPI = require('tuyapi');

const device = new TuyAPI({
  id: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  key: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'});

(async () => {
  await device.find();

  await device.connect();

  let status = await device.get();

  console.log(`Current status: ${status}.`);

  await device.set({set: !status});

  status = await device.get();

  console.log(`New status: ${status}.`);

  device.disconnect();
})();
```


## üìù Notes
- Only one TCP connection can be in use with a device at once. If using this, do not have the app on your phone open.
- Some devices ship with older firmware that may not work with `tuyapi`.  If you're experiencing issues, please try updating the device's firmware in the official app.
- Newer firmware may use protocol 3.3. If you are not using `find()`, you will need to manually pass `version: 3.3` to the constructor.
